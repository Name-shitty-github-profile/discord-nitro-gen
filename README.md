# discord-nitro-gen
OMG a nitro Generator!!!!<br><br>
# How useless is that?
You can have a discord nitro using a generator but, the chances of you getting one are extremely low. For example if you can (wich you can't because of discord rate limits) with 500 000 000 000 proxies, you have 2.0960075e-96 chances of having the right one if you try 255 times with all of your proxies every seconds wich means that it's going to take 13 800 000 000 years to have one nitro.
<br>
What computer do you need?
<br>
Here are the minimum specs of ram you need to be able to "mine" discord nitro
```
Ram : 500 000TB
```
Wich will cost : 50 000 000 000$<br>
Electricity cost per year : 46,586,400$
<br>
Only for the ram!
<br>
So paying 50 billions for discord nitro every 13 800 000 000 years wich at the end isn't the best.
<br>
# One year version
```
Ram : 6 900 000 000 000 TB
```
Cost of the ram : 69 000 000 000 000 $
# Alltime discord nitro
```
Ram per person : 8,280,000,000,000 TB
```
Cost of the ram per person : 828,000,000,000,000 $
# One nitro per second
This one is really usefull for giveaways
```
Ram : 2.14617600E+20 TB
```
Ram cost : 2.14617600E+25 $
# You can't generate discord nitros.
All of this for the conclusion that you can't generate discord nitros. The algorithm for mining them is done and here, try it and waste your money and time if you want :)
